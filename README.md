Project Description:
    WeatherWear is a fully Python based weather application that fetches the weather api from https://openweathermap.org/api (Weather API) 
    and then displayes the information fetched in an organized format. The main new function of this application is it recommends 
    what type of apparrel the user should wear based on how it feels outside(temperature) and the weather description(rain, clouds, sunny).
    Along with this information it will display the temperature at the top, below the recommended wear is the weather descrpition, 
    and below that on the left if the high temperature and to the right is the low temperature. The information displayed on the WeatherWear 
    uses the PyQT5 import for widgets, labels, styling, and format.
